1. Introduce

  The CLI project is similar with FortiGate's CLI, but it's code from scratch. I have two choices to implement CLI:
  1. using C/S design, the server side(named clid) to accept client's request, do the work, and return the response, it's like Mysql.
  2. using share memory to store all meta data and real data, and provide a set of API to manipulate this data.
  I using 2) implement CLI.

2. The goal
  The CLI need finished following functions:
  1. save config file like FortiGate's CLI config file.
  2. implement following function in FGT's CLI:
     a. user&privilege manager.
     c. implement "config" "get" "show" "exit" "edit" "set" "unset" "delete" "purge" "rename" commands.

3. The structure:
  It have 3 component:
  1. libcli.so: the library which implement object management, CLI query, and all plugins is here.
  2. confd: the CLI daemon, which recv client request, and return the result.
  3. cli: the CLI client program.
